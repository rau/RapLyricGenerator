How long I been on my head I can spend whatever on it
I understand, you got a house in LA, now I got to hit
Yeah, linking me down on my cell phone
You know it, they don't leave you alone
I had to bust up the city, you
That's why I ain't know we got thangs to do
I know that these streets just don't understand it
Weston Road Flows, I did this shit is candle lit
They re trying to take the money down
Landmarks of the other way around
I'm your brother shit, all that rap-to-pay-your-bill shit
You just trying to find it
I'm at the Derek up on the way it goes from there
And say I thought you were worried about where
My hooks did it, fuck, I don't do it, gave me
And I know that they gave us for free
